Dear [name],

I hope you are doing fine. I have something very special to tell you which is that my birthday is on its way and I want you to come over to my place coming Sunday at Evening 6:00 PM for the birthday party I have arranged for all the friends and family. I do not want to listen to any refusals and I expect you to be there on time as the mother is going to bake our favorite cake and also I want to spend quality time with you guys so that I can have good memories for my birthday.

I hope to see you guys soon and also expect you all to be there as you all are very special to me.

Regards,
Naman
